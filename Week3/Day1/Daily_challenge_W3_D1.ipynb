        "I selected a recent business case from 2024-2025 involving Netflix, where the company used advanced data analysis to decide which shows to renew or cancel. This case was widely reported in technology and business news.\n",

        "**Step 2: Analyze the role of data analysis in the chosen story**\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, data analysis played a central role because Netflix examined:\n",
        "\n",
        "Viewer behavior (watch time, completion rate, drop-off points)\n",
        "\n",
        "Demographic information (age, country, device)\n",

        "\n",
        "Social media sentiment\n",
        "\n",
        "These data sources helped Netflix understand what content viewers actually liked and how they interacted with the platform.\n",

        "**Step 3: Explain how the data analysis impacted the situation**\n",
        "\n",

        "Renewing shows with strong global engagement\n",
        "\n",
        "Cancelling shows with high drop-off rates\n",

        "Improving personalized recommendations to reduce subscriber loss\n",

        "**Step 4: Present the findings in writing, emphasizing the significance**\n",
        "\n",
        "This case shows the importance of data analysis in real business environments. For Netflix, data analysis ensured smarter decision-making, reduced financial risk, and improved user satisfaction. It also allowed the company to stay competitive by predicting trends and investing where viewer interest was strongest.\n",
        "Overall, data analysis was crucial for guiding strategy, optimizing content, and shaping the company's success."
